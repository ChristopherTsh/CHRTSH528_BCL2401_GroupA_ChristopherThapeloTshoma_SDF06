Css layout

This CSS code defines the styling for a web page layout, featuring a fixed side navigation bar (aside) with icons, and a main content area (page) utilizing CSS Grid for image galleries. The styling includes circular profile images, user profile settings, and statistics. Media queries ensure responsiveness, adjusting layout for smaller screens. Additionally, there are creative animations, including a loader and breath-like animation with circles. Hover effects are applied to display likes and comments on gallery items. The code balances aesthetics with functionality, providing a visually appealing and responsive web page.
